# Pico-Game-Controller-PNM
Minor modification to Speedypotato's PGC firmware to support 9-button Pop'n music mini-controllers with corresponding lighting   
(Major thanks to KyubiFox and Speedy for help)

Currently working/fixed:

- Gamepad mode - default boot mode
- NKRO Keyboard & Mouse Mode - hold first button(gpio4) to enter kb mode
- HID LEDs with Reactive LED fallback
- ws2812b rgb on second core
- 9 ws2812b hid descriptor zones
- sdvx/iidx spoof - Tested on EAC - checkout branches release/pocket-sdvx-pico or release/pocket-iidx
- 1000hz polling
- Reversable Encoders with debouncing
- Switch debouncing
- Switch and LED pins are now staggered for easier wiring
- Fix 0-~71% encoder rollover in gamepad mode, uint32 max val isn't divisible evenly by ppr\*4 for joystick - thanks friends
- HID LEDs now have labels, thanks CrazyRedMachine
 
 
Changes for PNM fork:
- Stripped out encoder function
- Minor adjustments to LED code, reactive buttons outside of HID with WS2812B
- Adjusted pinout and number of corresponding switches

TODO:

- refactor ws2812b into a seperate file for cleaner code & implement more RGB modes
- store configuration settings in a text file? consider implementing littlefs https://github.com/littlefs-project/littlefs https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=313009 https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1894014#p1894014
- Store last mode in flash memory (probably implement into above TODO if possible) https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=305570

How to Use:

- For basic flashing, see README in build_uf2
- Otherwise, setup the C++ environment for the Pi Pico as per https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf
- Build pico-examples directory once to ensure all the tinyusb and other libraries are there. You might have to move the pico-sdk folder into pico-examples/build for it to play nice.
- Move pico-sdk back outside to the same level directory as Pico-Game-Controller.
- Open Pico-Game-Controller in VSCode(assuming this is setup for the Pi Pico) and see if everything builds.
- Tweakable parameters are in controller_config.h
